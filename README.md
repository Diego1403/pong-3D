# pong-3D  
A 3D pong version made in Opengl  
Use the WASD keys to move player 1  
Use the 1234 keys to move player 2  
Player 1's view is the left one, and player 2's view is the right one  
When the ball reaches out of bounds, its position will be reset  
When it touches either the paddles or the cage's limits, the ball will bounce  
Sometimest it may seem as the ball went out of bounds and bounced, but it touched the cage's limits first
